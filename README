There are two main files in this project:

dcss-log-grabber.py
dcss-log-elo-analyser.py

The default way to run this is to go:

python dcss-log-grabber.py
python dcss-log-elo-analyser.py

The first of these takes a very long time, and the 2nd takes a reasonably long time to run the first time.

After this has been  done, you can just type:

python dcss-log-elo-analyser.py

with optional choices

python dcss-log-elo-analyser.py char/role/race

At the end it creates a file "eloscores.pickle". This can be opened with the python pickle library (as such):


---
import pickle
with open("eloscores.pickle", 'r') as f:
     eloscores = pickle.load(f)
---

eloscores is a dictionary of characters and players. The "characters" dictionary holds a dictionary of each char/role/race combo (as specified as a commandline argument), containing the full Elo history of that character as it goes against players and compares win rates.

The "players" dictionary has a list of all players and their full Elo update history.

To see the latest Elo of a character/player I have given some examples:

---
eloscores['players']['miek'][-1]
eloscores['players']['keymashgrqeeg'][-1]
eloscores['characters']['MiBe'][-1] # unfortunately these are case sensitive
eloscores['characters']['MuSu'][-1]
eloscores['characters']['Mi'][-1] # when race was selected on running the program
eloscores['characters']['Be'][-1] # when role was selected on running the program.
